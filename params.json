The package is most useful for generating biomass data and comparing biomass between various groups. There are also a couple of helper functions included and other scripts that help with moving samples through the processing pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The package can be downloaded from within R using the devtools function:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"econtijoch/Biomass-Workflow\")\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you need to install devtools first, you'll need to do the following first to download and update devtools to the most current version:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\tinstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n\tdevtools::install_github(\"hadley/devtools\")\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the functions has its own documentation that can further explain their usage (**working on updating this**). Here in the github, I have posted a sample mapping file that can be used as a basis for your own mapping files (SampleMapping.csv).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Known Issues </h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>When reading in Excel files, only the first sheet will be read into the input. Plan accordingly and save each sheet as its own file.</li>\r\n</ul>",
